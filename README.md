A simple RPN calculator written in C.

## About
This program accepts a normal infix expression, convert it into the RPN (Reverse Polish Notation), and calculate the result.

This calculator accepts the following operators: `'+', '-', '*', '/', '%'`, and also accepts grouping and precending with parentheses.

For now, it is only able to do interger calculations.

You can use the `-debug` option to display the stacks during calculation.
